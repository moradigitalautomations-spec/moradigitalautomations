# Mora Digital Automations — Website

This repository contains a simple static website for Mora Digital Automations. It is ready to publish with GitHub Pages.

## Files
- `home.html` — main site
- `style.css` — styles
- `script.js` — small interactivity
- `logo.png` — (optional) your logo file — replace with high-res logo

## Deploy with GitHub Pages
1. Commit files to the `main` branch.
2. Go to **Repository → Settings → Pages**.
3. For Source choose `main` branch and `/ (root)`.
4. Save — the site will be published at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/` (or `https://<your-username>.github.io/` if repo is named `<your-username>.github.io`).

## Notes
- Contact form uses `mailto:` fallback to your email. If you'd like server-side form handling (Formspree or Netlify forms) I can add it.
- To replace the inline `logo.png` upload your logo to the repo root and update the path if needed.
